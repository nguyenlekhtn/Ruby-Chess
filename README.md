# Ruby-Chess

## Background

I learned Ruby from The Odin Project's Ruby in Rail path. And this [Chess project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-ruby-final-project) is the final project of the Ruby section. It's the capstone project that required me to use all my gained programming knowledge to finish it.

I don't know how long it took others to complete it. For me, I used to decide to quit when I was in a difficult situation and need to apply for a dev job ( and actually got one). I planned to move forward to Rail section. But then I see others in TOP discord, who does the Ruby path like me, can complete it.  So I decided to come back and continue this project. But the time to complete this is still very long because I have to do my job too. But I did it: I completed the project!.

## Overview of what I applied in this project

+ OOP concept(inheritance, polymorphism, ...)
+ OOP principle(Single Responsibility, ...)
+ TDD
+ Refactoring
